## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Run `index.php` using command: `php index.php`

## Usage

The `Basket` class handles the products, delivery costs, and offers. It has the following methods:

- `__construct($products, $deliveryCost, $offers)`: Initializes the basket with the product catalogue, delivery cost rules, and offers.
- `add($productCode)`: Adds a product to the basket using the product code.
- `total()`: Returns the total cost of the basket, taking into account delivery and offer rules.

### Example

```php
$basket = new Basket($products, $deliveryCost, $offers);
$basket->add('B01');
$basket->add('G01');
echo "Total: $" . $basket->total(); // $37.85
```
